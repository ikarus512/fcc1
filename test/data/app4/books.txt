title: JavaScript: The Good Parts

description:

Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.

Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.

When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:

- Syntax
- Objects
- Functions
- Inheritance
- Arrays
- Regular expressions
- Methods
- Style
- Beautiful features

The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.

With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.

description:

What's the best approach for developing an application with JavaScript? This book helps you answer that question with numerous JavaScript coding patterns and best practices. If you're an experienced developer looking to solve problems related to objects, functions, inheritance, and other language-specific categories, the abstractions and code templates in this guide are ideal-whether you're using JavaScript to write a client-side, server-side, or desktop application.

Written by JavaScript expert Stoyan Stefanov-Senior Yahoo! Technical and architect of YSlow 2.0, the web page performance optimization tool-JavaScript Patterns includes practical advice for implementing each pattern discussed, along with several hands-on examples. You'll also learn about anti-patterns: common programming approaches that cause more problems than they solve.

- Explore useful habits for writing high-quality JavaScript code, such as avoiding globals, using single var declarations, and more
- Learn why literal notation patterns are simpler alternatives to constructor functions
- Discover different ways to define a function in JavaScript
- Create objects that go beyond the basic patterns of using object literals and constructor functions
- Learn the options available for code reuse and inheritance in JavaScript
- Study sample JavaScript approaches to common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Decorator, and more
- Examine patterns that apply specifically to the client-side browser environment

description:

"It's uncommon to have a programming language wonk who can speak in such comfortable and friendly language as David does. His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You'll find when you finish the book that you've gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery."
-Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome

"This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It's one of the few books on JS that I'll recommend without hesitation."
-Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google

In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language's flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you've been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs.

Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma's JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language's inner workings as never before-helping you take full advantage of JavaScript's expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you'll rely on for years to come.

Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You'll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include
- Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming
- Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects
- Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript's functions and variable scoping semantics
- Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining
- In-depth guidance on using JavaScript's unique "run-to-completion" approach to concurrency
